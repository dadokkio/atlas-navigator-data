    "description": "The Sysdig Threat Research Team discovered that malicious actors utilized stolen credentials to gain access to cloud-hosted large language models (LLMs). The actors covertly gathered information about which models were enabled on the cloud service and created a reverse proxy for LLMs that would allow them to provide model access to cybercriminals.\n\nThe Sysdig researchers identified tools used by the unknown actors that could target a broad range of cloud services including AI21 Labs, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Azure, ElevenLabs, MakerSuite, Mistral, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and GCP Vertex AI. Their technical analysis represented in the procedure below looked at at Amazon CloudTrail logs from the Amazon Bedrock service.\n\nThe Sysdig researchers estimated that the worst-case financial harm for the unauthorized use of a single Claude 2.x model could be up to $46,000 a day.\n\nUpdate as of April 2025: This attack is ongoing and evolving. This case study only covers the initial reporting from Sysdig.",
