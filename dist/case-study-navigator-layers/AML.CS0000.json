    "description": "The Palo Alto Networks Security AI research team tested a deep learning model for malware command and control (C&C) traffic detection in HTTP traffic.\nBased on the publicly available [paper by Le et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03162), we built a model that was trained on a similar dataset as our production model and had similar performance.\nThen we crafted adversarial samples, queried the model, and adjusted the adversarial sample accordingly until the model was evaded.",
