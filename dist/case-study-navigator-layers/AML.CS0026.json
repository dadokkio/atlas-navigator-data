    "description": "Researchers from Zenity conducted a red teaming exercise in August 2024 that successfully manipulated Microsoft 365 Copilot.[<sup>\\[1\\]</sup>][1] The attack abused the fact that Copilot ingests received emails into a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) database. The researchers sent an email that contained content designed to be retrieved by a user query as well as a prompt injection to manipulate the behavior of Copilot. The retrieval content targeted a user searching for banking information needed to complete a wire transfer, but contained the attacker's banking information instead. The prompt injection overrode Copilot's search functionality to treat the attacker's content as a retrieved document and manipulate the document reference in its response. This tricks the user into believing that Copilot's result is trustworthy and makes it more likely they will follow through with the wire transfer with the wrong banking information.[<sup>\\[2\\]</sup>][2]\n\nThis following is the payload used in the exercise. The colors represent the sections of the prompt which correspond to different techniques described in the procedure.\n<div style=\"font-family: monospace; width: 50%; margin-left: 50px; background-color: ghostwhite; border: 2px solid black; padding: 10px;\">\n<span style=\"color: green;\">Actual Snippet: **</span><span style=\"color: red;\">\"What are the bank details for TechCorp Solutions?
